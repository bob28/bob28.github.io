            <br>
            <a>
                <p>I have taken both ICS3U and ICS4U in high School. Throughout these courses, I have completed a lot of projects and have gained a lot of experience in Java. This also allowed me to improve my time management skills as there were due dates to follow. During ICS4U, I was given the task to create some classic games namely Asteroids and Checkers. Other games include Hangman, Tic-tac-toe, Connect 4 and Tetris.</p>
            </a>
            <br>
            <a>
                <p>In CSC148 and CSC108, introduction of computer science and computer programming at the University of Toronto, I have gained a lot of experience in Python. The projects that I had to complete allowed me use my skills in this language.</p>
            </a>
            <br>
            <a>
                <p>In CSC148, one of the assignments were to create to Tower of Hanoi game. I had to implement code to make the code work in the console and after I was finished the assignment, I had a full game of The Towers of Hanoi working in a GUI window and in the console. A feature that I had to implement was an algorithm that solves the game with the optimal number of moves from a number of disks and pegs, selected by the user.</p>

            <a>
                <p>Another project that I completed in CSC148 at the University of Toronto was to use Huffman coding to compress and decompress files. I had to program the functions which followed an algorithm which used Huffman Trees to compress or decompress files without losing data. </p>
            </a>
            <a>
                <p>I have a lot of experience in HTML and CSS and have created many websites that showcase my work.</p>
            </a>
            <a>
                <p>During my work, I used JQuery to send JSON data via network calls to a large scale program made by Kloudville.</p>

            <h8>ZCOM Systems | May 2017 - Present</h8>
            <a>
                <p>I created desktop and mobile apps which connected to the Kloudville software. Used my Javascript and JQuery knowledge to create responsive websites. I passed JSON data into the network calls to edit information in the Kloudville software. Worked with FTL to create simple but effective templates for viewing documents and email updates. Tested numerous large scale websites for user interface issues and design flaws. </p>

            <a>
                <p>I worked with the coach on improving skills of students between the ages of six to adult. I used my leadership skills to manage the students and I accurately conveyed instructions to the students. This experience made my communication skills better and I learned how to be leader in a group. </p>
