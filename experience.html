            <br>
            <p>I have taken both ICS3U and ICS4U in high School. Throughout these courses, I have completed a lot of projects and have gained a lot of experience in Java. This also allowed me to improve my time management skills as there were due dates to follow. During ICS4U, I was given the task to create some classic games namely Asteroids and Checkers. Other games include Hangman, Tic-tac-toe, Connect 4 and Tetris.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In CSC148 and CSC108, introduction of computer science and computer programming at the University of Toronto, I have gained a lot of experience in Python. The projects that I had to complete allowed me use my skills in this language.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In CSC148, one of the assignments were to create to Tower of Hanoi game. I had to implement code to make the code work in the console and after I was finished the assignment, I had a full game of The Towers of Hanoi working in a GUI window and in the console. A feature that I had to implement was an algorithm that solves the game with the optimal number of moves from a number of disks and pegs, selected by the user.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Another project that I completed in CSC148 at the University of Toronto was to use Huffman coding to compress and decompress files. I had to program the functions which followed an algorithm which used Huffman Trees to compress or decompress files without losing data. </p>
            <p>I have a lot of experience in HTML and CSS and have created many websites that showcase my work in high school. Through those experiences, I have learnt a little of JavaScript.</p>

            <p>I worked with the coach on improving skills of students between the ages of six to adult.

This experience made my communication skills better and I learned how to be leader in a group. </p>
