        <h8>City of Mississauga Tennis Lessons | Assistant Coach  |  November 2013 - January 2014</h8>
        <p>I worked with the coach on improving skills of students between the ages of six to adult. I used my leadership skills to manage the students and I accurately conveyed instructions to the students. This experience made my communication skills better and I learned how to be leader in a group. </p>
        <h8>Model United Nations | 2014 to present</h8>
        <p>I have used my communication skills and my innovative ideas to solve major world issues. I joined in grade 10 and still continue to represent the University of Toronto at conferences. This experience has taught me how a communicate my ideas effectively and this allowed me to more concise when speaking my thoughts. </p>
        <h8>DECA | 2014</h8>
        <p>I have taken part in the partner regionals in grade 11. This activity has also allowed me to gain experience in communicating ideas to people. </p>
        <h8>Tennis Team | 2012 to present</h8>
        <p>I represented my high school at tennis tournaments in Ontario. I also take part in the University of Toronto tennis team. I have been playing the sport for 14 years. </p>

            <h7>Programming Experience</h7>
        </center>
        <br>
        <p>I have taken both ICS3U and ICS4U in high School. Throughout these courses, I have completed a lot of projects and have gained a lot of experience in Java. This also allowed me to improve my time management skills as there were due dates to follow. During ICS4U, I was given the task to create some classic games namely Asteroids and Checkers. Other games include Hangman, Tic-tac-toe, Connect 4 and Tetris.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In CSC148 and CSC108, introduction of computer science and computer programming at the University of Toronto, I have gained a lot of experience in Python. The projects that I had to complete allowed me use my skills in this language.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In CSC148, one of the assignments were to create to Tower of Hanoi game. I had to implement code to make the code work in the console and after I was finished the assignment, I had a full game of The Towers of Hanoi working in a GUI window and in the console. A feature that I had to implement was an algorithm that solves the game with the optimal number of moves from a number of disks and pegs, selected by the user.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Another project that I completed in CSC148 at the University of Toronto was to use Huffman coding to compress and decompress files. I had to program the functions which followed an algorithm which used Huffman Trees to compress or decompress files without losing data. </p>
        <p>I have a lot of experience in HTML and CSS and have created many websites that showcase my work in high school. Through those experiences, I have learnt a little of JavaScript. <br> <a href='#top'>Back to Top</a></p
